Programming Interviews Problems
=============

In this repo I share some solutions I've built for common software interview problems.

I've not tried to make this solutions optimal, they may include more code than is necessary to solve the problem as I sometimes feel like expanding on the problem for practice.

I've tried to include reference to the problem and to comment my code, but it may not always be the case.

Some of these problems are from : 

- Cracking the coding interview by Gayle Laakmann
- The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena
- LeetCode.com
